# v1 Pre-Release Cleanup Summary

**Date:** November 11, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Files Removed

### Dead Code - Picks Feature (Replaced by FeaturedItems)
- `app/models/pick.rb` - Unused model
- `app/views/api/picks/_pick.json.jbuilder` - Unused view
- `PICKS_API.md` - Outdated documentation
- `PICKS_FEATURE.md` - Outdated feature spec

### Unused Controllers
- `app/controllers/settings_controller.rb` - Non-API settings controller (API-only app)

### Unused Mailer Boilerplate
- `app/mailers/application_mailer.rb` - Rails generated, never used
- `app/views/layouts/mailer.html.erb` - Unused mailer layout
- `app/views/layouts/mailer.text.erb` - Unused mailer text layout

## Routes Cleaned

Removed non-API settings route from `config/routes.rb`:
```ruby
# Removed:
resource :settings, only: [:show, :edit, :update]
```

## Database Cleanup

Created migration: `db/migrate/20251111000001_drop_dead_code_tables.rb`

Drops:
- `picks` table (replaced by `featured_items`)
- `media` table (orphaned, no model/controller exists)

## Migration Instructions

To apply database cleanup:
```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
```

## Notes

**Kept for now:**
- `API_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - May still be useful for client migration reference
- `API_RESPONSE_CHANGES.md` - Historical context for TMDB metadata changes

These can be archived or removed in a future cleanup if no longer needed.

---

**Result:** Codebase is now cleaner and ready for v1 🎉
